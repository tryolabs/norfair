        Associate trackers from different cameras/videos.

        Arguments:
         - distance_function: function that takes two TrackedObject instances and returns a non negative number.
            This indicates how you meassure the distance between two tracked objects of different videos.

         - distance_threshold: float.
            How far two clusters (group of trackers) need to be to not join them.

         - join_distance_by: str.
            String indicating how we combine distance between trackers to construct a distance between clusters.
            Each cluster will have several TrackedObject instances, so in our approach we can either take
            the maximum distance between their TrackedObject instances, or the average distance.
            Can be either 'max' or 'mean'.

         - max_votes_grow: int.
            For how many updates should we wait before increasing the size of a cluster, whenever
            a cluster we have is strictly inside another we currently see.

         - max_votes_split: int.
            For how many updates should we wait before increasing the size of a cluster, whenever
            a cluster we have is never inside another we currently see.

         - memory: int.
            Merge the information of the current update with past updates to generate clusters and vote (to grow, split or neither).
            This parameter indicates how far into the past we should look.

        - initialization_delay: int.
            When a new cluster is created, we wait a few frames before returning it in the update method, so that new clusters
            have the chance to be merged with other existing clusters.

        - reid_hit_counter_max: int.
            If doing reid in the tracking, then provide the reid_hit_counter_max so that the MultiCameraClusterizer instance knows
            for how long to keep storing clusters of tracked objects that have dissapeared.

        - maximum_time_since_last_update: int.
            Filter tracked objects that were not detected recently. This can be useful since those tracked objects might have
            position that will not match well with their position in a different camera.

        - keep_id_criteria: str.
            When splitting a cluster, we have to choose which subcluster will keep the id of the old cluster. We have 2 criterias;
            'age' criteria: the cluster with the oldest tracked object keeps the cluster id
            'hit_counter' criteria: the cluster with the tracked object with greatest hit_counter keeps the cluster id
